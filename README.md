## Download Felony
You can download compiled versions of Felony for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux from https://github.com/henryboldi/felony/releases. The app is currently in its pre-release stage, so it hasn't been fully tested on all platforms. Confirmed to be working on Mac, as that's what the developers own.

## Here's how it works...
1. Add public keys to your buddies list— A public key is like a username - Adding someone’s public key to your buddies list lets you send them messages. You can find other public keys on markets like [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/), [MIT PGP Public Key Server](https://pgp.mit.edu/) and darknet.
2. Encrypt a message— Select a recipient from your buddies list and compose a message. Only your chosen recipient(s) can read the message. Encrypted messages might contain sensitive information, such as an address, document, or anything intended to be read only by intended recipients.
3. Send the encrypted message anywhere— You can send the encrypted message on any website! For example, facebook messenger, twitter direct message, or youtube. Felony is security when and where you want it.
